### **Program objective**

The objective of this project is to implement a customized version of the popular game Nuclear Throne. Immerse yourself
in frantic action as you control a brave character whose mission is to mercilessly annihilate all the threats lurking in
the various scenarios of the map. But beware! To survive, you will have to loot the weapons strategically placed on the
terrain and make clever use of the limited bullets before reloading. Face hordes of randomly generated enemies as you
move nimbly through the confines of the maze - prepare for an explosive and addictive experience that will keep you on
the edge of your seat at every turn!
